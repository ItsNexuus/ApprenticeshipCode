        <footer> This page was made for a task for the Software Development Apprenticeship. It is a basic currency conversion app that uses a few currencies. The way that this works is through the use of JavaScript, and math equations using each of the currencies against eachother. It then displays in each box, from the currency selected, how much the inputted amount is in each of the currencies.</footer>
